// Install Node.js, TypeScript and VS Code on your computer.
 
// I have already installed Node.js on my computer, and I am sure about the version. 
//To check the installed version, I will use the command "node -v" in the terminal.

// As for TypeScript, I believe it is already installed on my system.
// However, to confirm this, I will run the command "npm list -g typescript" in the terminal,
 //which will list the globally installed packages, including TypeScript.

// Regarding Visual Studio Code (VS Code), I have successfully installed it on my computer.
// I can open the editor to start using it for my TypeScript projects.
