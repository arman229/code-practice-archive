// Task No:45
// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

interface myCarObject {
    manufacturer: string;
    model: string;
    [key: string]: any;  
}

    const car: myCarObject = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i += 2) {
        const key = args[i];
        const value = args[i + 1];
        car[key] = value;
