# Variables and simple data types.

- Naming and Using Variables
  Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
  They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.
  For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.
  • Spaces are not allowed in variable names but underscores can be used
  to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works
  but greeting message will cause errors.
  • Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.
  For example, do not use the word print as a variable name; Python
  has reserved it for a particular programmatic purpose. 
  • Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is
  better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better
  than length_of_persons_name.
  • Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O
  because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0
