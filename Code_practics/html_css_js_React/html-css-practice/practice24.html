            <h2>Gettysburg Address</h2>
        </div>
        <article>
            <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in
                Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.<br>
                Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
                dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a
                portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation
                might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br>

                But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this
                ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor
                power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can
                never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
                work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here
                dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased
                devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly
                resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new
                birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish
                from the earth.<br>
